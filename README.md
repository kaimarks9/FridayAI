***

create virtualenv :

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
Install virtualenv using pip if it's not already installed. Run the following command:

pip install virtualenv

2. Navigate to the directory where you want to create the virtual environment.
3. Create a new virtual environment using the virtualenv command followed by the name of the virtual 
environment. 
For example, to create a virtual environment named myenv, run the following command:

* virtualenv myenv

This will create a new directory named myenv in your current directory, which contains the virtual environment.

Activate the virtual environment by running the activation script in the bin directory of the virtual environment. The activation script is named activate and has different paths depending on the operating system:

* On Windows, run:

myenv\Scripts\activate

---

* On macOS or Linux, run:

source myenv/bin/activate

After activating the virtual environment, you should see the name of the environment in your terminal prompt.

Install any required packages or dependencies using pip. For example, to install the numpy package, run the following command:

pip install numpy

This will install the numpy package inside the virtual environment.

To exit the virtual environment, you can run the deactivate command in your terminal. This will deactivate the virtual environment and restore your previous Python environment.
